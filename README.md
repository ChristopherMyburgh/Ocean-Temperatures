# Ocean-Temperatures
Performing Linear Regression techniques to understand the relationship between various ecological features and Ocean Temperatures.

The analysis aims to explore and understand the relationships between various oceanographic and biological factors in the CalCOFI dataset collected from seawater samples spanning over 70 years off the coast of California. Specifically, the focus is on using linear regression analysis to investigate the connections between these factors. The dataset includes information on factors like temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, chlorophyll, and various biological characteristics of the marine ecosystem.
